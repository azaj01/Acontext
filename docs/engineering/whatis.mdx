title: What is Context Engineering?
---

Context Engineering is an emerging discipline focused on designing, managing, and optimizing the information provided to large language models (LLMs) and AI agents to enhance their performance, reliability, and consistency. 

While prompt engineering concentrates on crafting specific inputs, context engineering encompasses the entire spectrum of contextual elements that influence an AI system's behavior and outputs.

## Context Editing
Context Editing is the most important part of context engineering that keep your agent running smoothly.
Acontext provides [context editing methods](/engineering/editing) to help you limit the context window.

## Session Summary
Acontext provides [session summary](/engineering/session_summary) to help you get a compact summary of session state of agent.

## Agent Skills
Acontext provides [agent skills](/engineering/agent_skills) to help you empower your agents with agent skills.
It can execute code, analyze data, export artifacts.
